# AWS VPC Flow Logs – Hands-on Implementation

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of **AWS VPC Flow Logs** to monitor and analyze network traffic within an AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

The objective of this hands-on exercise is to understand how network traffic flows between resources in public and private subnets and how VPC Flow Logs help in troubleshooting, monitoring, and improving security visibility.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The architecture includes:

- Custom VPC
- Public Subnet
- Private Subnet
- Internet Gateway
- NAT Gateway
- Route Tables
- EC2 Instances
- VPC Flow Logs
- CloudWatch Log Group

## ⚙️ Services Used

- Amazon VPC
- Amazon EC2
- Internet Gateway
- NAT Gateway
- Amazon CloudWatch
- VPC Flow Logs

## 🎯 Objectives

- Create a custom VPC with CIDR block
- Configure public and private subnets
- Enable internet access using Internet Gateway
- Configure outbound internet access using NAT Gateway
- Launch EC2 instances in both subnets
- Enable VPC Flow Logs
- Send logs to CloudWatch Log Group
- Analyze ACCEPT and REJECT traffic logs

## 🧩 Implementation Steps

### 1️⃣ Create VPC
- Created a VPC with CIDR block `12.0.0.0/24`

### 2️⃣ Create Subnets
- Public Subnet: `12.0.1.0/24`
- Private Subnet: `12.0.2.0/24`

### 6️⃣ Enable VPC Flow Logs
- Enabled flow logs at VPC level
- Selected CloudWatch Log Group as destination
- Configured IAM role for logging permissions

## 📊 Flow Log Details

VPC Flow Logs capture:

- Source IP
- Destination IP
- Source Port
- Destination Port
- Protocol
- Traffic status (ACCEPT / REJECT)
- Bytes transferred
- Timestamp

> Note: Flow logs capture metadata only, not actual packet content.
